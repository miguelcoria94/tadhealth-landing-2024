                physician-patient relationship, whether or not User is referred
                to a physician or an appointment is booked through the Sites,
                (b) replace the services of a licensed, trained physician or
                health professional or (c) be a substitute for medical advice of
                a licensed physician or trained health professional. User should
                not rely on anything contained in the Site and should consult a
                licensed physician licensed in all matters relating to User’s
                health. User hereby agree that you shall not make any health or

                physician or other qualified health provider with any questions
                you may have regarding a medical condition. Never disregard
                professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of
                something you have read on the Sites. TADHealth does not
                recommend or endorse any specific tests, physicians, products,
                procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned

                PROVIDERS TO USER FOR ANY AND ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF
                ACTION WILL NOT EXCEED $100.00. IN STATES WHERE THE EXCLUSIONS
                AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE ARE NOT ALLOWED, TADHEALTH IS
                RESPONSIBLE TO USER ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A
                REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF ITS FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE
                CARE AND SKILL OR RESULTING FROM A MATERIAL BREACH OF THESE
                TERMS. TADHEALTH DOES NOT LIMIT LIABILITY TO USERS WHERE IT
                WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO. THIS SECTION DOES NOT AFFECT CONSUMER
                RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR
                AGREEMENT. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
                OF INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE
                LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO USER
                IF USER RESIDES IN SUCH A JURISDICTION. IF ANY PORTION OF THIS
                LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS FOUND TO BE INVALID, TADHEALTH’S
                LIABILITY WILL OTHERWISE BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT

                These Terms shall be treated as though they were executed and
                performed in Delaware and shall be governed by the laws of the
                State of Delaware and the laws of the United States without
                regard to conflict of law principles. Any claim or dispute
                related to the Sites or under these Terms, the Privacy Policy,
                and any legal notices on the Sites, must be instituted within

                date the first claim arose), or be forever waived and barred.
                User agrees that it will bring any claims in, and submit to the

                Construction. In the event that these Terms conflict with any
                agreement between User and TADHealth, or any additional terms of
                service or other agreements provided at any TADHealth physical
                location, these Terms shall govern. The failure of TADHealth to
                exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will
                not constitute a waiver of such right or provision or a waiver
                of any subsequent breach or default such provision. If any
                provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent
                jurisdiction or an arbitrator to be invalid, the parties
                nevertheless agree that the court or arbitrator should endeavor
                to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in that
                provision, and the other provisions of these Terms will remain
                in full force and effect. The section titles in these Terms are
                for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

                in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without
                the prior written consent of TADHealth. Any attempt to assign or
                transfer the Terms, without such consent, will be void.
                TADHealth may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in
                part, without restriction and without providing notice to or
                obtaining consent from User. The provisions of these Terms will

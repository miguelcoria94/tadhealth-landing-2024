                This Policy primarily concerns Personal Information, which deals
                with individuals, rather than organizations or businesses.
                “Personal Information” uniquely identifies an individual or can
                identify an individual by combining it with other data. It
                includes financial and account information, as well as email

                Children if this information is submitted by a Child with prior
                parental consent or by the parent or guardian of the Child. If a
                Service is directed to children under COPPA, we may ask users to
                verify their dates of birth before collecting any personal
                information from them. Those users that indicate they are
                Children are either blocked from the activity or taken through a

              <p class="mb-8">
                TADHealth may collect and store the following types of personal

                first and/or last name, email address, parent's or guardian's
                name, and parent's or guardian's email address. TADHealth may
                also collect the Child's mailing address and/or telephone number
                when necessary to respond to an inquiry or fulfill a
                transaction, such as sending the winner of a contest or
                sweepstakes the awarded prize. TADHealth may also collect
                demographic information about a Child such as the Child's date
                of birth, gender, toy and game ownership and other preferences,
                and combine such information with the Child's personal
                information. Please refer to the sections entitled “Information

                Additionally, we are prohibited by COPPA from conditioning a

                personal information than is reasonably necessary to use the
                Services. This means that if we don't need a specific piece of
                information (like the Child's phone number) to allow the Child
                to use the Services, we simply won't ask for it, even with
                parental consent. To read about the steps TADHealth takes to

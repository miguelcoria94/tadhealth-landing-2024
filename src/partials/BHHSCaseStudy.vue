                Beverly Hills High School is a public high school serving 1,300
                students in Beverly Hills, CA. The school is unique in its
                student mental wellness approach and has one of the nation’s
                first school based mental health centers, NormanAid Wellness
                Center (NAWC). The center provides counseling services, wellness
                programs and education, as well as referrals for support. NAWC
                provides over 2,000 sessions to the student body each year and
                while they have been able to support many students, the
                counselors have been challenged by the caseload management and
                communication with students outside of sessions. Center
                Director, Alison Norman-Franks shared the center’s biggest
                obstacle to date before TadHealth.“ We have been really lucky
                that students trust our counseling space, [however] it can be
                really hard to manage all of that. I have relied on my peer
                counselors to check students in [for appointments] with Excel
                sheets… It has been a lot to manage and overview the center and
                talk to students. That has always been one of my biggest
                challenges”.

                professionals and programs is more important than ever.”

                Alison chose to bring the TadHealth Mental Health platform to
                NAWC in order to give students the ability to safely book
                appointments and access to 24/7 crisis resources from a simple
                button.

                The need for students to easily access support and professional
                counseling is critical especially at the college level,
                according to Alison. She shared that TadHealth is directly
                solving an acute need in the K-12 and higher education system:
                “It can take some schools a month to get involved, and we know
                what can happen. It is unique to give people immediate access,
                it is really hard right now for people to get access.”

                Alison sees TadHealth as the perfect way to give students
                instant access to counselors’ schedules and view available
                appointments. Oftentimes, students would be sent to NAWC for an
                immediate issue and appointments would not be available. This
                would leave students frustrated and counselors feeling at a
                loss. “A lot of times they feel forgotten or worried we haven’t
                received their request, so with TadHealth we immediately know it
                is coming”, Alison shared. Now students can schedule their next
                appointment from their desk, so they do not have to leave class
                and also have peace of mind with the automatic feedback that an
                appointment has been scheduled.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-8">
                “TadHealth is beneficial to all students, but of course students
                we are worried about with their mental health, we want to make
                sure that they know support is available”, Alison shares that
                these students were prone to giving up in seeking out help and
                could fall through the cracks. The real-time relief students are
                provided when looking for help via TadHealth in addition to the
                resources available in the interim allow for the tailored
                approach Alison was seeking given the school’s unique mental
                health model. “I love how TadHealth is personalized, the student
                goes in and [recognizes] this is my school, this is for me.
                Every school is unique, every therapist is unique in their
                practice and their needs are very different,” Alison emphasizes
                the customization of the platform as a critical piece of its
                success at the school.
